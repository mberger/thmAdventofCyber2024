*McSkidy tapped keys with a confident grin,*

*A suspicious website, now where to begin?*

*She'd seen sites like this, full of code and of grime,*

*Shady domains, and breadcrumbs easy to find.*


McSkidy's fingers flew across the keyboard, her eyes narrowing at the suspicious website on her screen. She had seen dozens of malware campaigns like this. This time, the trail led straight to someone who went by the name "Glitch."

"Too easy," she muttered with a smirk.

"I still have time," she said, leaning closer to the screen. "Maybe there's more."

Little did she know, beneath the surface lay something far more complex than a simple hacker's handle. This was just the beginning of a tangled web unravelling everything she thought she knew.
