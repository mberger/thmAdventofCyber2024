## Congratulations on completing Advent of Cyber 2024!

Welcome to the last task of Advent of Cyber 2024! We are so proud that you reached it! Advent of Cyber is a beginner-friendly event; the challenge lies not in the difficulty of each day's task but in the persistence in coming back and learning regularly! For some, that means every day; for some, it's a few days a week; and for some, it's catching up on the weekends, and it truly doesn't matter, as you all did your absolute best and got to the end. In addition to all the new cyber security skills you have learned, you have now proven to yourself that you can be consistent about growing as a cyber security professional, and that's the most important skill of them all. 

We hope you enjoyed saving SOC-mas with Glitch and McSkidy. We certainly enjoyed putting the event together for you, and we already can't wait for the next one! Advent of Cyber will be back in 2025. To make it even better next year, we would like to invite you to give us some feedback. We made a survey for you to fill out. It's not a long one; it should only take 3 minutes to fill out! 

You can access the survey [here](https://forms.gle/7vsWJB8e9dNVHAmc6). 

See you in Advent of Cyber 2025,
